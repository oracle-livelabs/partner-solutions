Large Language Models (LLMs) are machine learning models that have been pre-trained or vast amounts of text data, and have exhibited an extraordinary capability in generating and summarizing content. In this workshop, we will learn how to fine-tune an open-sourced [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) model to automatically score a user's product review using the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Data Science service. We will then deploy the fine-tuned model to the OCI's managed infrastructure, and then use its prediction REST endpoint in a product catalog web application built using Oracle APEX.

Estimated Workshop Time: 90 minutes

### Objectives

In this workshop, you will:

* Provision an Oracle Autonomous Database.
* Provision an Oracle APEX workspace and database schema.
* Provision an OCI Data Science project and notebook session.
* Perform fine-tuning on an open-sourced [BERT](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1810.04805) base model for ranking reviews, and then deploy the model on the OCI.
* Build an Oracle APEX application that uses the fine-tuned LLM to automatically score a newly entered product review.

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:

* Access to an Oracle Cloud tenancy.
* Have a basic understanding of machine learning, Generative AI, and large language models.
* Basic knowledge of Oracle APEX and PL/SQL development.
* Some Python programming experience and understanding of [Conda](https://conda.io) is desired, but not required.
* Familiarity with OCI is helpful.
