# Use the ML Model in an Oracle APEX Application

## Introduction

In this final lab, we will gather the necessary information about the deployed machine learning (ML) model using its *OpenAPI Specification*, create an Oracle APEX application,

Estimated Time: 30 minutes

### OpenAPI

The OpenAPI Specification is a standard for describing and documenting RESTful APIs. It provides a machine-readable format (usually in JSON or YAML) that defines the endpoints, request and response formats, parameters, authentication methods, and other details of an API. These specifications assist application developers ensure that they correctly consume the API and adhere to its specifications.

### Oracle APEX

Oracle APEX is a low-code development platform that allows developers to quickly build scalable and secure web applications using a browser-based interface. It leverages the power of the Oracle Database and SQL, providing a robust backend for application development. Developers can create functional web applications rapidly by utilizing pre-built components, templates, and wizards. It offers a wide range of declarative features, such as drag-and-drop page design, data forms, interactive reports, and powerful data validations.

Oracle APEX provides a seamless integration with Oracle Database, enabling developers to leverage SQL and PL/SQL for data processing and implementing business logic. It also supports RESTful web services, allowing integration with external systems, including the ML model trained and deployed using the Oracle Machine Learning user interface.

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

* Gather the information required for working with the deployed ML model using REST.
* Create an Oracle APEX application that allows the user to manage records about HDB flats for sale.
* Predict the price of the HDB flat when a record is created.

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes that you have:

* Access to an Oracle Cloud tenancy.
* Provisioned a workspace and schema on the Oracle Autonomous Database.
* Performed all the steps for loading the open data set, use AutoML UI to generate, and deploy a machine learning model.

## Task 1: Gather Required Information for Calling the Deployed ML Model

1. In Lab 1, Task 1, you were introduced to the ADB's tools page. Return to the tools page, and then scroll down till you find the section *Oracle Machine Learning user interface* (OML UI). Click the button *Copy* to copy the URL to tool.
![Retrieve the URL to the Oracle Machine Learning user interface.](./images/get-link-to-oml-ui.png)
1. Login to the OML UI as the schema user, e.g., *`WKSP_LIVELABS`*.
![Login to the OML UI.](./images/login-to-oml-ui.png)
1. Click on the navigation menu that would be on the top-left corner of the page to display the menu. Click the menu item *Models* to view the list of available ML models.
![Navigate to list of available ML models.](./images/access-available-oml-models.png)
1. Click on the tab *Deployments* to view the list of deployed models.
![Navigate to list of deployed ML models.](./images/access-deployed-models.png)
1. Find the model that was deployed in Lab 3, Task 3. Under the column *URI*, click the URI assigned to the deployed model. In this example, the URI is `prfp`. This will open a modal containing the deployed model's OpenAPI Specification.
![Click the deployed model's URI link to view its OpenAPI Specification.](./images/view-openapi-specifications-for-deployed-model.png)
1. From the OpenAPI Specification, note the endpoint's `url`, `paths`, and `requestBody` attributes. From the information provided, we can glean that we need to make a HTTP `POST` request to the path `/omlmod/v1/deployment/prfp/score` with the *Content-Type* `application/json`. The HTTP request body should contain a valid JSON described by the schema `PRFP_NN_202307021843_INPUT_TYPE`.
    ![OpenAPI Specification for the deployed model.](./images/openapi-specification-for-deployed-model.png)
    Scrolling down, the specification describes the expected JSON schema that includes an array, `inputRecords`, containing one or more objects containing the attributes described.
    ![The input type JSON schema.](./images/request-input-type-attributes.png)

    In the example model deployed, the attributes include:
    * `BLOCK`
    * `FLOOR_AREA_SQM`
    * `LEASE_COMMENCE_DATE`
    * `STOREY_TO`
    * `STREET_NAME`
    * `TOWN`
    * `TRANSACTION_YEAR`

    Below is an example of what the request body JSON should look like:

    ```json
    {
        "inputRecords": [
            {
                "BLOCK": "410",
                "FLOOR_AREA_SQM": 72,
                "LEASE_COMMENCE_DATE": 1979,
                "STOREY_TO": 6,
                "STREET_NAME": "PANDAN GDNS",
                "TOWN": "JURONG EAST",
                "TRANSACTION_YEAR": 2023
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

    Finally, for the response, it will be a JSON payload based on the schema `PRFP_NN_202307021843_OUTPUT_TYPE`.
    ![The response body will contain a JSON payload.](./images/rest-response-json-payload.png)

    It is defined using the schema below:

    ![The output type JSON schema.](./images/response-output-type-attributes.png)

    And below, an example of the response body returned by the REST service.

    ```json
    {
        "scoringResults": [
            {
                "regression": 349278.09240880446
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

## Task 2: Create a Database Table to Store Records of HDB Flats

In this task, you will login to the Oracle APEX Development Environment that was created in Lab 1. The URL for Database Actions can be retrieved from the OCI console using the steps outlined in that lab's Task 2.

1. Login to apex
![Login to the Oracle APEX workspace.](./images/login-to-apex-workspace.png)
1. Go to *SQL Command*.

    <copy>
    create table resale_flat(
        resale_flat_id number generated always as identity
        , block varchar2(255) not null
        , street_name varchar2(255) not null
        , storey number not null
