# Introduction

## About this Tutorial

Java has a long history of running on the server. From the early days of servlets to JSP, Java web frameworks, Java EE, and Spring, to today’s hip microservice frameworks, the platform has been a strong, solid player, relied upon by thousands of companies, governments, and organizations. But what do these microservice frameworks like Dropwizard, Spring Boot, and Eclipse MicroProfile have in common with the older days of Java? It turns out, there’s quite a lot of foundational tech that made the newer frameworks possible. 

In this tutorial, we’ll take a look at different parts of the foundation that you may not even realize you’re using, for everything like handling REST requests, processing JSON, using Web Sockets, talking to a database, performing validation, and more. We’ll also look at how these standards evolve within the Eclipse Jakarta EE, and what’s in store for the future.

### Objectives

In this tutorial, you will learn:
* How modern microservice frameworks use Jakarta EE features
* Which Jakarta EE features are most commonly used
* What features MicroProfile and Spring Boot provide 
* How these features evolve, and how you can shape their evolution
