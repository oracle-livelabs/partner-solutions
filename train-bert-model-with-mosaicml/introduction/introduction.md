# Introduction

## About this Workshop

MosaicML was created to enable organizations of any size to develop large AI models efficiently and derive maximum value from their data. In this workshop, you will learn how to use the MosaicML Composer training library and the MosaicML Cloud platform to train a BERT language model from scratch on a custom dataset. Custom-trained models are able to achieve greater accuracy and deliver better results than models that are pre-trained on a generic dataset.

Estimated Workshop Time: 1 hour 30 minutes
