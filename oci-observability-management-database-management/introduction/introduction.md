# Introduction

## About this Workshop

As database administrators you are expected to manage a variety of Oracle deployments, such as Autonomous, Standard Edition, and Enterprise Edition databases.  Often monitoring and administration tasks are performed through a mixture of tools and utilities, including customized scripts, leading to extra monitoring overhead, configuration issues and incomplete database coverage or insight.

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure provides a managed cloud-native service, Database Management, which offers a unified console for on-premises and cloud databases with lifecycle database management capabilities for monitoring, performance management, tuning, and administration.

This workshop begins with provisioning of database resources and registering them with the Database Management service.  Once registered, you will explore and learn the capabilities of Database Management and how it eases management of many databases (fleet management).

Estimated Time: 2 hours, 20 mins
