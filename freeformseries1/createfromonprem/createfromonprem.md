# Create FreeForm application using an Oracle Essbase Outline

## Introduction

One of the main use cases for FreeForm application is the ease with which an Essbase outline can be used to build FreeForm application in Cloud EPM. 	![Use case summary for Oracle FreeForm applications](images/usecasesummary.png)
In this lab, we will use an existing Essbase outline for Aggregate Storage Option (ASO) and create a FreeForm application from it.

Estimated Lab Time: 7 minutes

### About creating FreeForm application using on-premises outline
Use Cloud EPM FreeForm application to migrate on-premises Essbase outline. The process will use an outline file from on-premises application to build the FreeForm ASO application.

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:
* Import an ASO outline to Cloud EPM
* Create a FreeForm application using the ASO outline

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:
* Access to an Essbase on-premises outline file
* An Oracle Cloud EPM Enterprise subscription
* Service administrator rights to the instance where you are going to create the FreeForm application


## Task 1: Creation Process

1. Hit **Start** under **Create a new application**.
