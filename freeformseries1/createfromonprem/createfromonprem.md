In this lab, we will use an existing Essbase outline for Aggregate Storage Option (ASO) and create a FreeForm application from it.

Estimated Lab Time: **8 minutes**

### About
Use EPM Cloud FreeForm application to migrate on-premises Essbase outline. The process will use an outline file from on-premises application to build the FreeForm ASO application.

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:
* Import an ASO outline to EPM Cloud
* Create a FreeForm application using the ASO outline

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:
* Access to an Essbase on-premises outline file
* An Oracle EPM Enterprise Cloud subscription
* Service administrator to the instance where you are going to create the FreeForm application
