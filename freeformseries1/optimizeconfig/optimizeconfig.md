# Optimal configuration tips

## Introduction

There are certain considerations to optimize a FreeForm application. This lab will start the process of building to optimize some such configuration, one of which was already done during the creation of the **Scratch** FreeForm application during the previous lab. 

Estimated Lab Time: **7 minutes**

### About
In addition to understanding **Period** dimension configuration, you will also be uploading additional dimensions paving the way for follow-on optimal configurations in the following workshop and labs.

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:
* Adjust configurations of FreeForm application namely **Scratch** that you just created using the **Application Creation Wizard**.

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:
* An Oracle EPM Enterprise Cloud subscription
* Service administrator rights to the instance where you are going to create the FreeForm application


## Dimension configuration

1. Navigate to dimensions in the application created in the previous lab. Click on **Overview** and the navigate to **Dimensions**.
