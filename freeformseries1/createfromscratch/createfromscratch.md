# Create FreeForm application using the Application Creation Wizard (from Scratch)

## Introduction

You can also use the **Application Creation Wizard** in Oracle Cloud EPM to create FreeForm applications. This lab will walk you through the steps of creating a FreeForm application with multiple plan types or cubes. For more information check [Managing cubes](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/planning-budgeting-cloud/pfusa/plantype.html)

Estimated Lab Time: 8 minutes

### About creating FreeForm application using Application Creation Wizard
While a few initial steps will be the same as the previous lab, creating FreeForm application using the **Application Creation Wizard** vastly differs from importing an Outline or a Snapshot. You will learn how to quickly get a FreeForm application stood up with dimensions across multiple cubes.

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:
* Create a FreeForm application using the **Application Creation Wizard** aka **Create from Scratch**
* Create multiple **cubes** in the application

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:
* An Oracle EPM Enterprise Cloud subscription
* Service administrator rights to the instance where you are going to create the FreeForm application


## Task 1: Creation Process

1. Hit **Start** under **Create a new application**.

2. Populate **Name** and **Description** for the FreeForm application being created.

3. Under **Application Setup** select **Create Cubes**.

4. You can select upto 12 cubes to create. We will be creating 2 cubes in this lab.

5. These cubes can be a combination of **block storage (BSO)** and/ or  **aggregate storage (ASO cubes)**. For more information on **Multi-Cube FreeForm Applications** check [Understanding FreeForm Applications](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/planning-budgeting-cloud/pfusa/understanding_freeform_apps.html). For this exercise we will select 2 cubes. We will make one of the cubes an ASO cube.

6. Upon hitting **Next** the **Create Dimensions** screen shows up.

7. Enable both **Account** and **Period** type dimension and rename them to **Measures** and **FiscalPeriod** respectively. We will discuss why this is important during the **Optimizing FreeForm Applications** lab (next lab). Hit **Next**.

8. Review and hit **Create** in this next step.

9. Track the status through Creation of the FreeForm application.

   Keep your FreeForm application intact that was created from this lab for the next lab.
