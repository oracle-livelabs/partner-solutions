# Populate Database Schema

## Introduction

Our next step is to create and populate all needed tables and other database objects. This lab assumes that you have already created your Oracle Autonomous Database 23*ai* Always Free instance and explored the database tools available for accessing your database environment, especialy SQL Developer Web.

Estimated Time: 10 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

- Create database objects and populate them with data
- Create an Operational Property Graph view for querying and analyzing the social media campaign's data and relationships

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have completed all previous labs successfully.

## Task 1: Create and populate database tables and related objects

1. Log in As the **hol23** user using the password *Future1sNow#*:

    ![Log in as HOL23](images/login-hol23-user.png)

2. Open your local directory where you downloaded all the scripts and files.

    ![Log in as HOL23](images/sdw-reopen-as-hol23.png)

    ![Open SQL Tools](images/sdw-open-file-dialog.png)

3. We will now build and populate all of the database objects needed to demonstrate the features of the VECTOR datatype.

- Open the file named **create_tables.sql** by clicking on the *File ... Open* icon. 
- Click the button that shows a document with the small green play button - the *Run Script* button - or simply hit *F5* to execute the script.

4. Review the tables have been created properly in the left-hand panel. 

   ![Review list of created tables](./images/created-table-list.png)


5. Now let's populate the tables that comprise the social media network and messages exchanged between personas in that network. Select the **ENTITIES** table, click the right-mouse button, select the *Data Loading* option, and then choose the *Upload Data ...* option.

   ![Choose table loading option](./images/select-table-loading-option.png)

    When prompted, select the **entities.csv** file from the directory where you downloaded files.

   ![Select loading source file](./images/select-loading-source-file.png)

    When the file is ready for loading, it will appear with a *Pending* status in the upper-left corner. Click the *Upload* button to start the loading process.

   ![File load pending](./images/file-load-pending.png)

    The table should load in a few seconds; when the process is finished, the file's status will change to *Uploaded* and you can now click the *Close* button.

   ![File load completed](./images/file-load-complete.png)


6. *Repeat this same process* to load the **INTERACTIONS, MESSAGES,** and **RELATIONSHIPS** tables using each table's corresponding CSV file.


7. If desired, you can browse the contents of each table by highlighting it in the left-hand panel and selecting the *Open* option:

   ![Choose table for review](./images/review-loaded-data.png)

    Here's a brief example of the contents of the **ENTITIES** table. You can just click the *Close* button in the bottom-right-hand corner to close this window.

   ![Review loaded data](./images/entities-loaded-data.png)


8. Open and execute the script named **create-constraints.sql** to apply primary key and foreign key constraints to these four tables.

   ![Create constraints](./images/create-constraints.png)


9. Open and execute the script named **create-opgs.sql** to create a new *Operational Property Graph* (OPG) named **SMI_PAYLOADS.** Our APEX application and PL/SQL packages will use this view in future steps to navigate the contents of and relationships between social media posters and postings.

   ![Create OPGs](./images/create-opgs.png)

10. Open and execute the script named **pkg-rag-processing.sql** to create a new PL/SQL package (OPG) named **PKG_RAG_PROCESSING.** Our APEX application will use this package's procedures and functions to interface with various database-resident 23ai generative AI features via PL/SQL.

   ![Create PL/SQL package](./images/compile-pkg-rag-processing.png)

11. **Your schema setup is now complete.** You may proceed to the next lab.
