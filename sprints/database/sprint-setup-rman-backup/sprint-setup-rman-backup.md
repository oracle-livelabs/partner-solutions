# How do I setup Oracle RMAN Backup? 

Duration: 12-15 minutes

## Setup Oracle RMAN Backup? 

In Oracle, Recovery Manager (RMAN) is a utility that can be used to backup and recovery the database. To backup the target database it needs to be registered in Recovery catalog to store metadata. When you backup using RMAN all backups will be registered in Recovery catalog. If you have taken backup without catalog and you can also register manually.

1.	Connect to recovery catalog and register Database 

	```
	<copy>
	$rman target / catalog rcat/ rcatpassword@rcatdb	
	</copy>

	Recovery Manager: Release 19.0.0.0.0 - Production on Wed May 31 12:55:27 2023
	Version 19.10.0.0.0

	Copyright (c) 1982, 2019, Oracle and/or its affiliates.  All rights reserved.

	connected to target database: RCATDB (DBID=4567445670)
	connected to recovery catalog database
	```

	```
	<copy>
	RMAN> REGISTER DATABASE;
	</copy>

	database registered in recovery catalog
	starting full resync of recovery catalog
	full resync complete
	```

    When the database is registered RMAN provides defaults for parameters that will allow basic backup and recovery. You can set the persistent configuration settings for each target database to configure backup retention policy, default backup device type, default backup destination, controlfile auto backup and so on.  

2.	Show the RMAN configuration for the target database

    Use “SHOW ALL” to see the parameter defaults of the target database and you can also use SHOW command with parameter name

	```
	<copy>
	RMAN> SHOW ALL; 
	</copy>
	```

	```
	<copy>
	RMAN > SHOW RETENTION POLICY.
	</copy>
	RMAN configuration parameters for database with db_unique_name ORCL are:
	CONFIGURE RETENTION POLICY TO RECOVERY WINDOW OF 3 DAYS;
	```

3.  How to change RMAN Configuration settings for the target database

    Use CONFUGURE to view or change the configuration.

    * To change backup retention policy to 30 days

		```
		<copy>
		RMAN> CONFIGURE RETENTION POLICY TO RECOVERY WINDOW OF 30 DAYS;
		</copy>

		starting full resync of recovery catalog
		full resync complete
		new RMAN configuration parameters:
		CONFIGURE RETENTION POLICY TO RECOVERY WINDOW OF 30 DAYS;
		new RMAN configuration parameters are successfully stored
		starting full resync of recovery catalog
		full resync complete
		```
    * To turn on controlfile auto backup 

		```
		<copy>
		RMAN> CONFIGURE CONTROLFILE AUTOBACKUP ON;
		</copy>

		new RMAN configuration parameters:
		CONFIGURE CONTROLFILE AUTOBACKUP ON;
		new RMAN configuration parameters are successfully stored
		starting full resync of recovery catalog
		full resync complete
		```

    * To change default backup destination and format

		```
		<copy>
		RAMN> CONFIGURE CHANNEL DEVICE TYPE DISK FORMAT '/backup/ORCL/db_%d_t%t_s%s_p%p.bkp';
		</copy>

		starting full resync of recovery catalog
		full resync complete
		new RMAN configuration parameters:
		CONFIGURE CHANNEL DEVICE TYPE DISK FORMAT '/backup/ORCL/db_%d_t%t_s%s_p%p.bkp';
		new RMAN configuration parameters are successfully stored
		starting full resync of recovery catalog
		full resync complete
		```

    * To change default backup destination of controlfile auto backup and format

		```
		<copy>
		RMAN> CONFIGURE CONTROLFILE AUTOBACKUP FORMAT FOR DEVICE TYPE DISK TO '/backup/ORCL/cf_%d_t%t_s%s_p%p.bkp;
		</copy>

		starting full resync of recovery catalog
		full resync complete
		new RMAN configuration parameters:
		CONFIGURE CONTROLFILE AUTOBACKUP FORMAT FOR DEVICE TYPE DISK TO '/backup/ORCL/cf_%d_t%t_s%s_p%p.bkp;
		new RMAN configuration parameters are successfully stored
		starting full resync of recovery catalog
		full resync complete

		```
4.	Take database backup using RMAN 

    * To backup database and archive logs
		```
		<copy>
		RMAN> RUN {
		ALLOCATE CHANNEL c1 DEVICE TYPE DISK;
		BACKUP DATABASE PLUS ARCHIVELOG; 
		}
		</copy>
		```

    * To backup Pluggable Database and archive logs
		```
		<copy>
		RMAN> RUN {
		ALLOCATE CHANNEL c1 DEVICE TYPE DISK;
		BACKUP PLUGGABLE DATABASE ORCL_PDB1 PLUS ARCHIVELOG;
		}
		</copy>
		```

    * To backup archive logs and delete archived logs after they backed up

		```
		<copy>
		RMAN> RUN {
		ALLOCATE CHANNEL c1 DEVICE TYPE DISK;
		BACKUP ARCHIVELOG ALL DELETE INPUT;
		}
		</copy>
		```
