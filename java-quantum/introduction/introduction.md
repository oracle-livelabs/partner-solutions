In this workshop, you will use quantum gates in Java to create a key distribution application.

Quantum computing has several key concepts including superposition, entanglement, and measurement. This lab covers only superposition. We avoid mathematical equations in favor of more intuitive descriptions.

Quantum computing impacts security in at least two ways. 

* **Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)** - Distributing shared private keys in a secure manner.
* **Shor's Algorithm** - Breaking encryption schemes such as RSA and Diffie-Hellman by efficiently factoring large public keys.

This workshop uses superposition to demonstrate Quantum Key Distribution.

Estimated Time: 1 hour 30 minutes 

### Objectives

In this workshop, you will:
* Run high-level quantum computing code in Java to generate random bits.
* Run the corresponding low-level code in Java.
* Perform experiments with quantum gates and qubits.
* Run code to distribute secret encryption keys.

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:
* Basic Java programming skills
