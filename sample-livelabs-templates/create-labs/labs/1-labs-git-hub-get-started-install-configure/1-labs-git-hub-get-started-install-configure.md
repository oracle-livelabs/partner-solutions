# Get Started with Git and Set up the GitHub Environment

## Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to create a GitHub Account and associate it with your email account, set up the GitHub development environment, and install GitHub Desktop.

### Objectives

* Submit a LiveLabs workshop request through email
* Create a GitHub account and add it to the Oracle GitHub Organization.
* Set up your GitHub environment.
* Install GitHub Desktop Client.

## Task 1: Submit a Workshop Request to the Oracle LiveLabs

Before you get started, you should submit your new LiveLabs workshop request by sending an email to [livelabs-help-community_us@oracle.com](livelabs-help-community_us@oracle.com) for the Oracle LiveLabs team to review. Submitting a workshop informs the Oracle ecosystem that you are working on a workshop and submits your idea to the Workshop Council. We urge you not to delay this step. There are hundreds of workshops already, this step is important to help us preserve the quality and integrity of the workshop catalog.

1.  Download this [Submit Workshop Details document](https://objectstorage.us-ashburn-1.oraclecloud.com/p/Vi68eJYNv_M4E-j-lE2-2cWItoiOG8dLZOUWSZBaHoj248RB0xGjBH8An8S4ehTd/n/id05dmgeno0f/b/partner-solutions/o/Submit_Workshop_Details_v1_072222.xlsx) and provide all the below required *Workshop Information*. Failure to provide all the details will prevent your workshop from being approved.

	-	*Workshop Title:* Choose a descriptive title up to 200 characters. Do not include the word "Workshop" or "Lab" and use "Oracle Speak". Choose a title that users would recognize or understand. Do not use abbreviations ("Autonomous Database" not "ADB") and start the title with an imperative verb ("Build" not "Building").
	-	*Workshop Abstract:* Provide the workshop abstract details **thoroughly** as it is used for approval by the workshop council. Workshops are reviewed by the workshop council for adherence to current Oracle messaging. If you do not provide enough details, the council may revert back for more details and this may delay your workshop approval.

Users have to complete the workshop in a specified limited amount of time. After their reservations expire, any instances they create will be destroyed. However, users can extend their reservations up to 4 times.
	- 	*Workshop Time*: The time to complete the entire workshop
	-	*Anticipated Completion Date:* When do you anticipate this workshop to be completed?

2. Provide the *Social* details like share a link to the blog of your workshop, write a couple of sentences that would accompany a LinkedIn post about your workshop, and write a tweet (limit 240 characters) to be used to promote your workshop.

We recommend you do not start working on your workshop until your workshop has been approved by the workshop council. Once your workshop is submitted, it will be sent to the workshop council. The workshop council will approve your workshop or ask for more details within 3 business days through email. If you have not heard back from your council group after 3 business days, please email them to [livelabs-help-community_us@oracle.com](livelabs-help-community_us@oracle.com). Once approved, you will be entered into the workflow and given additional steps to progress through to production.

## Task 2: Create and Set Up Your GitHub Account

In this Task, you will create and set up your GitHub account.

1. Create a free GitHub Account here: [GitHub Web UI](https://github.com/) if you don't have one.

    ![Download Git](./images/git-download-install-create-account.png " ")

2.  If this is a new account, use your email ID to register.

    > **Note:** Do not create a secondary new account to join GitHub.

3. Go to [GitHub Settings](https://github.com/settings/profile) and configure the following:
    *   Set your Name.
    *   Add your Profile Picture.

4. Click **Account** to add your user name in the **Enter a user name** dialog. For example, johnhall.

5. We recommend setting a 2 Factor Authentication here: [GitHub Security](https://github.com/settings/security).

## Task 3: Download and Install the latest version of Git (Optional Step)

> **Note:** If you are new to Git and Github, we recommend using the GitHub Desktop client because of its simple and user-friendly user interface. Therefore, skip this task and follow the instructions in **Task 4: Install GitHub Desktop** if you are not familiar with command-line interface.

To install Git:

1. Install Git for your operating system from the [Git download site] (https://git-scm.com/downloads).

2. Click the required option under **Downloads** (**Windows** in this example) and save the installer file.

3. Browse to the downloaded location and double-click the file to launch the installer.

4. Click **Yes** in the **User Account Control** dialog box.

5. Click **Next** in the **GNU General Public License** dialog box.

6. Under **Choose the default behavior of `git pull`**, leave the selected **Default (fast-forward or merge)** option as is and click **Next**.

7. In the **Configuring experimental options** dialog box, click **Install**.

## Task 4: Install GitHub Desktop

The GitHub Desktop application is a UI client for Windows and Mac that simplifies the complex set of GitHub command line arguments. GitHub Desktop is a fast and easy way to contribute to projects and it simplifies your development workflow.

To set up the GitHub Development Environment and install **GitHub Desktop**:

1. Download and install **GitHub Desktop** from [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).

2. When the software is successfully installed, open the **GitHub Desktop**.

  ![GitHub desktop login screen.](./images/git-hub-desktop-login-screen.png " ")

3. Click **File > Options > Sign in**, enter your GitHub **Username** or **email address**, **Password**, and then click **Sign in**. You will receive an authentication code sent to your cell phone. Enter this code in the **Authentication code** field in the **Sign in** dialog box.

    > **Note:** The authentication code is valid only for a few seconds.

	You are now logged in to **GitHub Desktop**.

  ![GitHub desktop main screen.](./images/get-started-git-hub-desktop.png " ")

## Task 5: Fork Repositories of the oracle-livelabs Project on Your GitHub Account

After your workshop is approved by the council group, you will be creating your workshop and labs in the [oracle-livelabs/partner-solutions](https://github.com/oracle-livelabs/partner-solutions) repository of the **oracle-livelabs** project. You must fork the repository to create a duplicate personal copy of the repository on your GitHub account. You own the forked (stage) repository, and you can edit its contents without affecting the parent (production) repository.

For example, if a user named **anooshapilli** forks the [oracle-livelabs/partner-solutions](https://github.com/oracle-livelabs/partner-solutions) repository in the **oracle-livelabs** project, a duplicate repository [anooshapilli/partner-solutions](https://github.com/anooshapilli/partner-solutions) is created.

To create a workshop in the [oracle-livelabs/partner-solutions](https://github.com/oracle-livelabs/partner-solutions) repository, you need to fork the **partner-solutions** repository. The following steps walk you through forking the **partner-solutions** repository, in the oracle-livelabs GitHub project.

1. Log in to the [GitHub Web UI](http://github.com), using your GitHub account.

2. Navigate to the [oracle-livelabs/partner-solutions](https://github.com/oracle-livelabs/partner-solutions) repository.

3. Click **Fork**.

	In this example, we are forking the goldengate repository but the following process is the same for forking your **partner-solutions** repository.

  ![Fork](./images/fork.png " ")

4. Under **Owner**, expand the dropdown list and select your username. You can accept the **Repository name** as it is. Click **Create fork**.

  ![Create fork](./images/create-fork.png " ")

5. Then, your user has forked the **partner-solutions** repository.

	As you can see, arabellayao user has forked the goldengate repository.

  ![Local repository](./images/local-repo.png " ")

In the next task, you will clone this forked repository.

## Task 6: Clone the Forked Repository

A clone is a copy of your forked repository that lives on your local computer instead of on [GitHub Web UI](http://github.com). When you clone your forked repository, you can edit the files in your preferred editor, such as **Atom** editor, or **Visual Studio Code**, and use the **GitHub Desktop** client to keep track of your changes without having to be online.

To clone the forked **partner-solutions** repository:

1. Open your **GitHub Desktop** application and log in using your GitHub account.

2. Click **File > Clone repository** to display the **Clone a Repository** dialog box.

    ![Clone repository.](./images/git-hub-desktop-clone-repository.png " ")

3. Select your repository such as **your account/repo** from **Your Repositories**.  Under **Local Path**, select the local path on your machine where the repository is going to be cloned (copied). This is where the repository files get copied to your local file system. Click **Clone**.

	In this example, arabellayao/goldengate is selected.

    ![Available repositories dialog box.](./images/clone.png " ")

4. The cloning process may take several minutes, depending on how big the repository is.

  ![Cloning](./images/cloning.png " ")

5. When asked how you plan to use the fork, select **To contribute to the parent project**. Click **Continue**.

  ![Contribute to parent project.](./images/contribute-to-parent.png " ")

6. The repository files will appear in the local path you just specified. You can now start working on your labs and workshops!

	In this case, it is goldengate.

  ![Successfully cloned repository.](./images/git-hub-my-cloned-repository.png " ")

	Once you make a clone, you can create your project folder, edit the files in your preferred editor, such as **Atom** or **Visual Studio Code**, and use **GitHub Desktop** to keep track of your changes without having to be online.

	> **Note:** The repository you cloned (local version) is connected to the your fork (remote version) so that you can push your local changes to the remote to keep them synced when you are online.

7. You can also use Github Desktop to synchronize the changes that you have made in your local file system to the forked content on your GitHub repo. More details on using Github Desktop in Lab 4 of this workshop.

  ![Synchronize with GitHub.](./images/github-desktop-sync.png " ")

This concludes this lab. You may now **proceed to the next lab**.
