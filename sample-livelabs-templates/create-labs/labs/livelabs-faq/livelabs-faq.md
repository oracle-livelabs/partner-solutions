8.	How to register for a workshop?
    -	Once you finalize the workshop you want to run, click on the workshop tile and click  **Start** button.
    -	Run on your tenancy:
        - If customers want to run the workshop on their own tenancies, click the **Run On Your Tenancy**.
        - Then you can view the workshop instructions to run through the workshop.
    -	Run on LiveLabs:
        - If you want to run the workshop on LiveLabs tenancy, click the Green button – **Run On LiveLabs**.
        - Provide credentials of the account registered with Oracle (SSO) and sign in.

        - On My Reservations page, once the provisioning is done, click **Launch Workshop** to view the workshop instructions and click on **View Login Info** on top of the workshop title to view the workshop reservation information.
9.	If I request a workshop, does it mean that the workshop will be able to run on Oracle's tenancy?
    -	Not all of the workshops have the "Run on LiveLabs" button to reserve a workshop enabled.
    -	It goes by what that particular workshop is configured to run on. e.g. If the workshop is configured to run on both freetier & paid, the workshop will have "Run on your tenancy" button.
10.	Is there a way to view the workshop instructions without reserving a workshop and securing an environment?
    -   Workshops and environments do not have to be reserved. All workshops can be executed on-demand on any kind of environment, freetier, or paid. Only certain workshops run and are pre-provisioned on an Oracle tenancy.
    -	A customer would not reserve an environment to execute a workshop on the freetier, it’s on-demand. Click on any of the **Run on Your Tenancy** button to view the workshop instructions.
11.	What to do if I am unable to launch a workshop's reserved tenancy using Run on LiveLabs button?
    -   If you are already logged into your own tenancy when clicking on the LiveLabs link, the LiveLabs reservation login link will skip the tenancy login (because according to the system you have already authenticated to your own tenancy) and tries to navigate to the assigned LiveLabs tenancy.
    -	Please make sure you are logged off completely from your own tenancy or use another (private) browser window to connect.
