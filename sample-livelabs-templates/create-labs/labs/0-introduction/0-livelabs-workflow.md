# Need to Understand the Status in LiveLabs?

### **Oracle LiveLabs GitHub Project and Repositories**

We organize workshops into GitHub repositories according to their product or feature groups, in the Oracle LiveLabs own GitHub project called [oracle-livelabs](https://github.com/oracle-livelabs). Those repositories are referred to as **Production**, since they are where customers view the completed LiveLabs workshops from.

> **Note:** You will be working in one of the **oracle-livelabs** Github project repositories called **oracle-livelabs/partner-solutions**. You can access the repository using this URL - [https://github.com/oracle-livelabs/partner-solutions](https://github.com/oracle-livelabs/partner-solutions). We recommend to bookmark this URL, as you will use it often.

### **Understanding the Roles and Responsibilities**

**Workshop author or the workshop team** are the workshop developer(s) who submit the new workshop request to the LiveLabs team and edit and update their workshop. They are also responsible for answering questions related to the workshop and performing regular quarterly QA of the workshop.

**LiveLabs Team or the workshop council group** determine whether a workshop fits messaging to protect the integrity of catalog content and are workshop approvers (or rejectors). They are also responsible for helping the workshop author or the workshop team to navigate the workshop development life-cycle and answer any questions related to workshop development.

## **LiveLabs Workshop Workflow**

Before you start, please check LiveLabs ([developer.oracle.com/livelabs](https://developer.oracle.com/livelabs)) to see if there is already a workshop similar to the content you want to create. If you see content that resembles yours and can be developed further, please contact that LiveLabs team to see if you can cooperate with the workshop team on the enhancement of the workshop. If not, please proceed.

For a workshop to go from an idea to a LiveLabs workshop in production, it has to go through the following phases or statuses. You can refer to this section to see your current and next steps.

1.  The workshop author or the workshop team submits the new workshop request (see details in Lab 1 -> Task 1) by emailing to [livelabs-help-community_us@oracle.com](livelabs-help-community_us@oracle.com). The new workshop request will be considered to be in *Submitted* status. Oracle LiveLabs workshop's *council* team will review the workshop within 2-3 business days. Council will either approve the workshop and move it to *Approved*, or ask the workshop team for more information and move it to *More Info Needed*.

2. Council will mail the workshop team for *more information* if needed. The workshop team will respond to the council via email [livelabs-help-community_us@oracle.com](livelabs-help-community_us@oracle.com) with the updates to get the workshop approved.

3. Council *approves* the workshop and shares you the ID of the workshop. Now, the workshop team can start developing the workshop. Refer to the notification email to see your action items.

4. Council will move the workshop to *In Development* once you start workshop development. The workshop team can refer to Lab 1 to Lab 4 to see workshop development-related instructions.

5. After development, the workshop team will update the council when they start perform the self QA of the workshop. Then the council will move the workshop status to *Self QA*. Follow Lab 4 -> Task 8 to self-QA the workshop.

6. Once the Self QA of the workshop is completed, the workshop team will notify council and mail the completed Self QA form to [livelabs-help-community_us@oracle.com](livelabs-help-community_us@oracle.com). The council will update the workshop status to *Self QA Complete* and will verify the QA within 2 business days.

7. The council will either send workshop team issues to fix if any, or move the workshop to *Completed* status, meaning the workshop is ready for publishing. LiveLabs team will submit a publishing request, and approve it. After the publishing request is approved, the workshop will be live in LiveLabs automatically within a business day.

The following workflow shows the workshop development lifecycle from submitting a workshop to publishing on Oracle LiveLabs.

The following diagram shows the general workflow process that your need to follow to set up your environment to develop labs and workshops. Most of the tasks are performed only once.
