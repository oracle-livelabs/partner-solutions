# Introduction to Labs and Workshops

Welcome to LiveLabs and creating workshops to give practical hands on experiences for Oracle Products and technologies. This is the place to demonstrate use cases and allow users to explore and gain valuable knowledge with Oracle Cloud, Applications and Database. 

This workshop is to help walk you through the process of creating your own workshop. It will walk you through all of the steps, processes even how to do quality checks to build a successful workshop.

> **Note:** If you have any questions or concerns through out the process of workshop development life-cycle, contact Oracle LiveLabs team through email - [livelabs-help-community_us@oracle.com](livelabs-help-community_us@oracle.com).

### **What is Oracle Contributor Agreement (OCA)**

The Oracle Contributor Agreement (OCA) is a legal document that gives Oracle and the contributor joint copyright interests in code contributed by the contributor to Oracle-sponsored open-source projects. An approved OCA is valid for all Oracle-sponsored open-source projects. Oracle employees do not need to sign the OCA. The Oracle Contributor Agreement Signing Service (OCASS) allows contributors to sign the OCA electronically and enables OCA reviewers will review and approve/reject OCAs.

> **Note:** For the community members to contribute content and create a pull request to  oracle-livelabs/partner-solutions repo, you need to fill out the Oracle Contributor Agreement (OCA) document which will be sent to you after your first pull request is created (if you havenâ€™t done that yet). If you are member of the Oracle Organization you don't have to do that.

### **What are Labs and Workshops?**

Labs are a set of step by step instructions to complete a task as part of the hands-on experience. A workshop is the collection of the labs provided in a specific order to complete the overall set of instructions. A workshop should have an introduction and then at least two labs to work through. The workshop has the big picture of the what the user is going to accomplish by completing all or some of the labs listed in the workshop.

An individual Markdown (.md) file is the document and text that makes up a lab. For each lab there is a markdown and the workshop has files that will call each lab and put them in order. In most cases, this is not a problem since most of the LiveLabs workshops contain at least one common lab titled **Get Started** that guides the user on the different types of Cloud accounts.

Markdown files and images that are part of the lab instructions are kept in **oracle-livelabs/partner-solutions** a GitHub repository, which we will give details on later.

### **What's next?**

Before you get started with the development of labs and workshop, check out existing workshops on LiveLabs. There are some great examples out there and can give you new ideas.

Also use the sample workshop that is found in [https://github.com/oracle-livelabs/partner-solutions](https://github.com/oracle-livelabs/partner-solutions) under the  sample-livelabs-templates directory. (Steps will be provided later on setting up your GitHub repos).

Another important step is to take look at the QA document since it provides how to do images, format markdown and gets you started in the right direction for the workshop standards.


### Workshop Objectives

* Submit your workshop details
* Prepare your environment to develop the workshop.
* Review a few Markdown features and other tips.
* Perform QA on your workshop.
* Get your workshop ready to publish.

This concludes this lab. You may now **proceed to the next lab**.
