# Create OCI Resources for the Application

## Introduction

In this lab, we will provision the required Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) components to support the Oracle APEX application that we will create in the next lab.

Estimated Time: 15 minutes

### About the OCI Resources

Oracle APEX is a low-code software development platform that is included with every Oracle Autonomous Database (ADB) provisioned. The OCI Object Storage is a storage solution that is accessible over both public and private networks, highly-performant, and resistant to hardware failures. It offers different storage tiers and features that cater to different use cases and requirements.

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

* Provision a new Oracle Autonomous Database to host the web application.
* Create an Oracle APEX workspace and database schema to create a web application to store documents.
* Create an Object Storage bucket that will store uploaded documents.

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes that you have created the following OCI *Identity and Access Management* (IAM) resources:

* A compartment for placing the Object Storage bucket.
* A group that is used in policy statements.
* A policy and statements that define actions that members of a group may perform.
* A user assigned to a group with the required permissions to manage objects in the target bucket, and generated the API key pair.

## Task 1: Provision an Autonomous Database

1. Click the *navigation menu* (sometimes known as the "hamburger") button on the top left to show all the available menu items on the OCI Console, *Oracle Database*, and then *Autonomous Database*.
![Navigate to the Autonomous Database page.](./images/navigate-to-the-autonomous-database-page.png)
1. Click the *Create Autonomous Database* button.
![Click the Create Autonomous Database button.](./images/create-a-new-autonomous-database.png)
1. Begin by choosing the target compartment to create the database. Next, enter a suitable *Display name* and *Database name*. Then, select the desired the workload type, for example, *Transaction Processing*.
![Enter a suitable display and database name, and then choose the desired workload type.](./images/enter-required-details-for-new-autonomous-database.png)
1. Scroll down and select the *Shared infrastructure* deployment type. For this workshop, select *Always Free* option if within the tenancy's service limits. For Always Free databases, the *OCPU count* and storage limits are fixed. Also, auto scaling is not available for both OCPU and storage. Select the database version *19c* and then scroll down again.
![Specify if this is an Always Free instance, and if required, provide the OCPU and storage limits.](./images/configure-autonomous-database-resources.png)
1. Enter a password (twice) that meets the database's password complexity rules. It must be between 12 and 30 characters long and must include at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one numeric character. It should not include the word *admin*.
![Enter a valid password for the autonomous database.](./images/enter-valid-password-for-autonomous-database.png)
1. Scroll down once more. If this is an Always Free ADB, then the license type choice is set. If not, select the license type that is appropriate to the tenancy. Next, optionally provide an email address to be contacted about announcements and notifications concerning the newly provisioned instance. Finally, click the *Create Autonomous Database* button.
![Select the license type and provide contacts for the ADB.](./images/select-license-type-and-provide-contacts-for-autonomous-database.png)

## Task 2: Create an Oracle APEX and Database Schema

1. Once the ADB has been fully provisioned, return to the *Autonomous Database* page, locate the instance's display name, and then click on it to view the ADB's details page. Click the *Tools* tab.
![Navigate to the ADB's tools page.](./images/navigate-to-autonomous-database-tools-page.png)
1. Click the *Open APEX* button to launch the *App Builder* in a new browser tab/window.
![Launch the Oracle APEX App Builder.](./images/launch-oracle-apex-app-builder.png)
1. For new ADB instances, this should launch the *Administration Services* login screen. Enter the password for the *admin* user and click the *Sign In to Administration* button.
![Login to the Oracle APEX Administration Services.](./images/login-to-oracle-apex-administration-services.png)
1. Again, for new ADB instances, after a successful login, the browser will redirect to the page shown below. Click the *Create Workspace* button.
![Click the Create Workspace button.](./images/create-a-new-workspace.png)
1. Click and select the *New Schema* option.
![Select to create a workspace using a new schema.](./images/create-workspace-using-a-new-schema.png)
1. Enter the desired *Workspace Name* and *Workspace Username*. The latter will be used to create an Oracle Database user account. Also, provide a new *Workspace Password* that conforms to the same password policy described in *Task 1*. Click the *Create Workspace* button to create the workspace.
![Provide the desired workspace name, and the administrator's username and password.](./images/provide-workspace-name-and-admin-credentials.png)
1. After the workspace has been successfully provisioned, click the button on the top-right, and then click the *Sign out* button to return to the App Builder login screen.
![Sign out of the Administration Services.](./images/sign-out-of-administration-services.png)
1. Enter the workspace name, username, and password set earlier when creating the workspace. Click the *Sign In* button to access the newly created workspace.
![Login to the new workspace.](./images/login-to-new-workspace.png)
1. After successful authentication, the browser will redirect to the default App Builder landing page where workspace administrators and developers will have access to various functionalities to develop and manage APEX applications.
![Once signed in, the workspace administrator and developers have access to the App Builder and a few other utilities.](./images/oracle-apex-development-environment-home-page.png)

## Task 3: Create an Object Storage Bucket

1. In the final task of this lab, we will create an OCI Object Storage that will be used to store documents uploaded by the APEX application's users. Launch the navigation menu, click *Storage*, and then *Buckets*.
![Go to the Bucket page on the OCI Console.](./images/navigate-to-the-bucket-page.png)
1. On the Buckets page, ensure that the intended compartment has been selected, and then click the *Create Bucket* button.
![Click the Create Bucket button.](./images/create-a-new-bucket.png)
1. Enter the desired *Bucket Name* and select the *Standard* storage tier. For this workshop, it is not necessary to select any other Object Storage features. Click the *Create* button to create the new bucket.
![Enter the preferred name of the bucket.](./images/enter-preferred-name-of-bucket.png)
1. Verify that the bucket has been created successfully.
![Check that the bucket was successfully created.](./images/validate-bucket-created-successfully.png)

You may now **proceed to the next lab**.
