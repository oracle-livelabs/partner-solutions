# Introduction

## About this Workshop

In this workshop you will learn how train the model for image classification using Vision AI service and how to use that model in Oracle Analytics in order to clasify new X-Ray images for pneumonia. 

This exercise begins with setting up an image library of X-Ray images representing pneumonia infected and normal lungs. Images are not ready as all images needs to be labeled to start vision ML model training. Once all images in training dataset are labeled, model is created and deployed. To conclude this workshop, Vision ML model is registered with Oracle Analytics and used in new images classification for pneumonia.

Estimated Workshop Time: 4 hours (depending on the model training duration selected)
